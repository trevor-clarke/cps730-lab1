Exactly what it says on the title, the TODO app lists and displays your tasks and appointments, ready to be added and checked at a moment's notice, adding the checked tasks under the completed tasks title.

The TODO App currently holds 3 basic components:

- "Add" Textbox
   A simple textbox and a checkbox to click in order to add in the list below.

- List of Current Tasks
   - Box to check the tasks after completion
   
- List of Done Tasks
   - In order to archive the tasks and keep track of any misclicked undone ones, this list displays every task that has been clicked on.
   

Here are the screenshots of our todo app interface:

Users are able to enter the name of new tasks in the text box and click "add Task" button.

A user can select the checkboxes in front of task names to select multiple tasks, and press the completed button to mark them as done.
